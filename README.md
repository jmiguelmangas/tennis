Tennis AI detection tool with YOLO, Deep Learning and AI

To properly work with the model you have to download in your computer with Python and run the program, this will install the yolov8x in your computer after a few minutes.

This repository doesn't include the yolo model itself because of its size, that is greater than 100mb and problematic with the github conditions.
